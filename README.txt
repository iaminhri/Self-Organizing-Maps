Hello,

I hope you are doing well.

The graphs and data are stored in the graphs and data folder.
The python code of SOM implementation is in the folder of SOM - Implementation

Inside SOM - Implementation, there is requirements.txt, please install the requirements.txt 

pip install -r requirements.txt

There is config file that helps with hyperparameters. You can tweak from there. 
Once a graph shows up, upon closing it will go for the next step of the program.

Thanks for taking the time to read the document.

Best Regards,
Hridoy Rahman
